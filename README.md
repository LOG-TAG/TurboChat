## Sample Chat application called.

Sample Chat application done in reactive way using RxJava2. Note that projects requires
gradle plugin in version `2.3.0-rc1` and `constraint-layout`.

I simulate network calls with retrofit network behavior, binding with server is not done,
so please use `mock` flavor (there's not production implementation).
